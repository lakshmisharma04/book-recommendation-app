# Book Recommendation App 
This is my journey to build a unique book recommendation and community app.<br>
This app is inspired by Goodreads and Fable which has convenient features but might sometimes feel outdated and biased. My goal is to create a modern, user-friendly platform that provides honest and reliable recommendations while fostering an ardent community for readers.<b>
Welcome to a book recommendation app which focuses on creating reliable and secure authentication system to protect user data while ensuring completely unbiased book recommendations.
