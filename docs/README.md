# ðŸ“š Book Recommendation App  

Hey there! This is my journey to create something Iâ€™ve always wanted as a reader â€”  
a book community app thatâ€™s actually fun, unbiased, and convenient.  

Iâ€™ve used Goodreads and Fable, and while theyâ€™re great, I often felt they could do better.  
So I decided to build my own version â€” one that feels more **human, unbiased, and community-driven**.

## ðŸŒŸ What I plan to build 
- Personalized recommendations (so you actually discover books youâ€™ll love)  
- A clean, distraction-free interface. 
- Honest community reviews & discussions.  
- Tools to track, share, and celebrate your reading journey. 

---

## ðŸ›  Techn I'll be using  
- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind CSS (for a modern, simple UI)  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express (to power the appâ€™s engine)  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (via Supabase, free & open source)  
- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth (so users can sign in easily)

## ðŸš€ Goals of the Project  
1. Build the foundation (frontend + backend setup)  
2. Make it social with profiles, reviews, and ratings  
3. Add a smart recommendation engine  
4. Deploy it so readers around the world can try it out

âœ¨ This is more than just a project â€” itâ€™s me learning, experimenting, and building something Iâ€™d personally use every day.
